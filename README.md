## Installation

If you already have Plato installed, simply download latest release [here](https://github.com/thataboy/plato/releases) then extract the entire zip file's content into where Plato is installed, usually `./adds/plato`, overwriting everything (your settings will be preserved).

If this is your first time installing Plato, the easiest way is to get the
[Plato one-click install package from mobileread.com](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=314220). After installing that, do the step above to install my version of Plato.
